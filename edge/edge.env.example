# Environment variables for compose.release.yml

# GitHub Container Registry owner/namespace.
#
# Why this exists:
# - Lets you point a node at a *test* image namespace (fork / new repo) without editing compose files.
# - Makes it trivial to migrate from personal -> GitHub org later.
#
# If you want maximum simplicity and never plan to change namespaces, you can hardcode it in
# `edge/compose.release.yml` and delete this variable.
GHCR_OWNER=YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME

# Edge SemVer (corresponds to git tag edge/vX.Y.Z and GHCR image tags)
EDGE_VERSION=1.0.0

# Required: pin 3rd party images (for reproducible deployments)
#
# Recommended: pin by digest from a known-good node (most reproducible):
#   victoriametrics/victoria-metrics@sha256:<digest>
#
# Helper:
#   From repo root on a node running the stack:
#     ./scripts/pin_third_party_images.sh edge edge/compose.dev.yml
