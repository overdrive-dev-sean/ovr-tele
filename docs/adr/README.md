# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

We use ADRs to record decisions that are:
- hard to reverse
- likely to be forgotten
- needed to explain "why" to future contributors

## Naming
- `NNNN-short-title.md`

## When to write an ADR
Examples:
- choosing deployment/release strategy for edge nodes
- changing metrics schema or compatibility guarantees
- switching database/storage format
